# Custom instructions for Co-pilot

## Project Context

A personal to-do list application built using Django, SQLite3 and Tailwind CSS.
We will use a root level templates folder for base.html and app-level templates for app specific templates (appname/templates/appname). 
We will use class-based views with efficient queries. 
We will have a minimalistic, dark-mode theme for styling. 

## Indentation
